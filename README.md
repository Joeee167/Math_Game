# Description
- The project's aim was to practice using some c++ concepts and dealing with enums and rand() function
- I used enums as an easier way to deal with some conditions for difficulty level and operation type info.
- I also used rand() function for creating the questions mainly if the user needs a quiz with mixed difficulty levels or op types.
